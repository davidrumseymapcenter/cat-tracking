# Catalog Progress Tracking
This repository contains GitHub Issues related to cataloging progress. As items are acquired, an Issue is created to log the the new item, track communication, and plan work cycles. When Issues are created a "label" should be applied to each one.

# Labels

  - **Purchase**: The item(s) was purchased with DRMC funds
  - **Joint Purchase**: The item(s) was purchased collaboratively with DRMC + SUL funds
  - **Gift**: The item(s) was gifted to the DRMC
  - **Remediation Major**: The item record(s) needs major remediation work
  - **Remediation Minor**: The item record(s) needs minor remediation work

# Project Tracking
These Issues will be tracked in the Project named [Cataloging](https://github.com/orgs/davidrumseymapcenter/projects/3). When an Issue in this repository is created is is not automatically added to this Project. It will be up to the descretion of DRMC staff to identify which items will be worked on during the next work cycle. When items have been identified, they should be added to the Cataloging Project. Once the Issues are added to the Cataloging project, they will automatically be shown in the "Up Next" panel.
## Project Cycle Panels
### Up Next
These items have been identified as the ones to prioritize over the next work cycle. Issues are automatically categorized as "Up Next" when added to the Cataloging Project.
### In Progress
These items are being actively worked on. Click and drag the item to move an item from "Up Next" to "In Progress". 
### Done
These items are complete. Click and drag the item to move an item from "In Progress" to "Done". When the item moves to "Done" the Issue will be closed.
